# Type 2
## Tasks

### Problem 1
Generate images using [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) and share them in the `Stable_Diffusion` folder.
Within your Pull Request, mention the prompt and configurations used to generate the image. As such a visual representation is subjective,
we'll have judges who will pick the best images and they will be accepted.

You can use Hugging Face's Jupyter Notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_diffusion.ipynb)
to generate your images if you do not have access to a GPU.
